TYPECLASS TODO:
1. ADT derive from typeclass
2. Typeclass superclass
3. Type in multiple typeclasses

ADT TODO:
1.


- An adt in a typeclass MUST have implementations of the listed functions with the types defined
- Only 1 typeclass per adt
- Overloads on derived adt's are implicit and optional
- :> and <: for bounded types only
- Sets in Collection Types
- Lazy Evaluation (need to figure out lazy parameters)
- Polymorhpic parameter as a part of type syntax
- Polymorphic inference, ex: print[int](5) to print(5). [] is omitted due to inference of parameter type

# overloaded methods
instance Car : VehiclesMethods = {
    fn getWheels() -> int = 4
    fn getYear() -> int = 2022
}

type Semi : Vehicle { }

val v: Vehicle = Car(4, 2020)
val v2: Vehicle = Semi(14, 2015)

println(v.getYear()) # 2022 - uses overloaded typeclass method to get literal value '2022' instead of this.wheels
println(v2.getYear()) # 2015 - uses typeclass method from Vehicle super-type

type Bike { wheels: int }

# Bounding polymorhpic type T to Vehicle subclasses
fn printWheels[T :> Vehicle](v: T) -> null = {
    println(v.wheels)
}

fn makeCar() -> Car = Car(4, 2012)

# bird operator for function chaining
makeCar() |> printWheels[Car]()

# Bounded type-list
fn collHead[T :> { List, Array, Tuple, Set }, U](coll: T[U]) -> U = {
    coll.head()
